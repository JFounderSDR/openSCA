	 * @brief The releaseObject operation terminates execution of the application, 
	 *        returns all allocated computing resources, and de-allocates the 
	 *        resources’ capacities in use by the devices associated with the 
	 *        application. Before terminating, the application removes the message 
	 *        connectivity with its associated applications (e.g., ports, resources, 
	 *        and logs) in the domain.
	 *
	 * The following behavior is in addition to the LifeCycle::releaseObject operation 
	 * behavior. The Application::releaseObject operation shall release each 
	 * application component not created by a resource factory by utilizing the 
	 * component’s Resource::releaseObject operation. The Application::releaseObject 
	 * operation shall release each component created by a resource factory via the 
	 * ResourceFactory::releaseResource operation. The Application::releaseObject 
	 * operation shall terminate a resource factory when no more resources are managed 
	 * by the resource factory via the ResourceFactory::shutdown operation. The 
	 * Application::releaseObject operation shall terminate the processes / tasks on 
	 * allocated executable devices belonging to each application component by 
	 * utilizing the ExecutableDevice:terminate operation. The releaseObject operation 
	 * shall de-allocate the memory associated with each application component 
	 * instance from its allocated device by utilizing the LoadableDevice::unload 
	 * operation. 
	 * 
	 * The releaseObject operation shall deallocate the device capacities that were 
	 * allocated during application creation. The actual devices deallocated 
	 * (Device::deallocateCapacity) reflect changes in their capacity based upon 
	 * component capacity requirements deallocated from them, which may also cause 
	 * state changes for the devices.
	 * 
	 * The application shall release all object references to the components making 
	 * up the application.
	 * 
	 * The releaseObject operation shall disconnect ports that were previously 
	 * connected based upon the application’s software profile.
	 * 
	 * The releaseObject operation shall disconnect consumers and producers from a 
	 * CORBA Event Service’s event channel based upon the software profile. The 
	 * releaseObject operation may destroy a CORBA Event Service’s event channel when 
	 * no more consumers and producers are connected to it.
	 * 
	 * For components (e.g., Resource, ResourceFactory) that are registered with 
	 * Naming Service, the releaseObject operation shall unbind those components and 
	 * destroy the associated naming contexts as necessary from the Naming Service.
	 *
	 * The releaseObject operation for an application shall disconnect ports first, 
	 * then release the resources and the resource factories, then call the terminate 
	 * operation, and lastly call the unload operation on the devices.
	 * 
	 * The releaseObject operation shall, upon successful application release, 
	 * write an ADMINISTRATIVE_EVENT log record.
	 * 
	 * The releaseObject operation shall, upon unsuccessful application release, 
	 * write a FAILURE_ALARM log record.
	 * 
	 * The releaseObject operation shall send a DomainManagementObjectRemovedEventType 
	 * event to the Outgoing Domain Management event channel upon successful release 
	 * of an application. For this event,
	 * 		1. The producerId is the identifier attribute of the released application.
	 * 		2. The sourceId is the identifier attribute of the released application.
	 * 		3. The sourceName is the name attribute of the released application.
	 * 		4. The sourceCategory is “APPLICATION”.
	 *
	 * The following steps demonstrate one scenario of the application’s behavior 
	 * for the release of an application that contains ResourceFactory behavior:
	 * 		1. Client invokes releaseObject operation.
	 * 		2. Disconnect Ports.
	 * 		3. Release the ResourceFactory components.
	 * 		4. Shutdown the ResourceFactory components.
	 * 		5. Release the Resource components.
	 * 		6. Terminate the components’ processes.
	 * 		7. Unload the components’ executable images.
	 * 		8. Change the state of the associated devices to be available, along with 
	 * 		   device(s) memory utilization availability and processor utilization 
	 * 		   availability based upon the Device Profile and software profile.
	 * 		9. Unbind application components from Naming Service.
	 * 		10. Log an Event indicating that the application was either successfully 
	 * 			or unsuccessfully released.
	 * 		11. Remove the application reference from the applications attribute 
	 * 			and generate an event to indicate the application has been removed 
	 * 			from the domain.
	 *
	 * @exception The releaseObject operation shall raise a ReleaseError exception 
	 *            when internal processing errors prevent the successful release of 
	 *            any application component.
